Goal: A Clear Path from Configuration to Control
The objective is to establish a single, unambiguous pipeline for initializing the LED matrix that works for production, development, and testing. The desired flow is:

A configuration source (like production_config.json) defines the physical hardware layout.

A loader reads this configuration.

The LEDMatrix class acts as a factory, consuming the configuration to build the grid of live HybridLEDController objects.

The main application and tests use this LEDMatrix object as the single source of truth for interacting with the LEDs.

Here are the changes needed across the project to implement this structure.

Step 1: Solidify the Configuration Loader
The config/loader.py module should be the single entry point for loading any matrix configuration. It should be flexible enough to load from a file (for production) or accept a dictionary directly (for testing).

File to Edit: config/loader.py

Required Changes:

Create a ConfigLoader class that centralizes loading logic.

# In config/loader.py
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Any

class ConfigLoader:
    """Handles loading of the matrix hardware configuration."""

    def __init__(self, config_data: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        """
        Initializes the loader, optionally with pre-existing config data.
        """
        self._config = config_data

    def load_from_file(self, filepath: str) -> None:
        """
        Loads the hardware configuration from a JSON file.

        Args:
            filepath: The path to the JSON configuration file.
        """
        try:
            with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                self._config = json.load(f)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Handle error appropriately
            print(f"Error: Configuration file not found at {filepath}")
            raise
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            # Handle error appropriately
            print(f"Error: Could not decode JSON from {filepath}")
            raise

    def get_led_config(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Returns the 'leds' part of the configuration.
        """
        if not self._config or 'leds' not in self._config:
            # Return empty list or raise an error if config is invalid
            return []
        return self._config['leds']


Step 2: Confirm the LEDMatrix as the Factory
The src/bongo/matrix/matrix.py file should contain the one and only LEDMatrix class. Its role is to be a factory that correctly interprets the configuration data passed to it. The version we have recently worked on is already very close to this. The key is that its __init__ method robustly uses the config list to create its internal dictionary of HybridLEDControllers.

File to Confirm: src/bongo/matrix/matrix.py

No Changes Needed (based on our last version): The current implementation, which accepts config and default_pca9685_class, is correct for this architecture. It correctly acts as the factory.

Step 3: Connect Everything in the Main Application
This is the most critical step to fix the disconnect. The main application entry point, presumably src/bongo/app.py, must be updated to use the ConfigLoader and the LEDMatrix.

File to Edit: src/bongo/app.py

Required Changes:

The main execution block should explicitly use the new components.

# In src/bongo/app.py
import time
from config.loader import ConfigLoader
from src.bongo.matrix.matrix import LEDMatrix
from src.bongo.operations.animation_manager import AnimationManager
# Import the real hardware class for production
from src.bongo.hardware.pca9685_hal import PCA9685

# --- Constants ---
PRODUCTION_CONFIG_PATH = "config/production_config.json"

def main():
    """Main application entry point."""
    print("ðŸš€ Bongo is starting up...")

    # 1. Load the configuration
    print(f"Loading production configuration from: {PRODUCTION_CONFIG_PATH}")
    loader = ConfigLoader()
    loader.load_from_file(PRODUCTION_CONFIG_PATH)
    led_config = loader.get_led_config()

    if not led_config:
        print("Configuration is empty or invalid. Exiting.")
        return

    # 2. Create the LEDMatrix instance (the factory)
    # The matrix is now the single, authoritative object for all LED control.
    print("Initializing LED Matrix...")
    matrix = LEDMatrix(
        config=led_config,
        default_pca9685_class=PCA9685 # Provide the REAL hardware class for production
    )

    # 3. Initialize the AnimationManager with the real matrix
    print("Initializing Animation Manager...")
    animation_manager = AnimationManager(matrix=matrix)

    # 4. Run patterns, animations, etc.
    #    (Your application's main loop would go here)
    # --- Example Usage ---
    # from src.bongo.patterns.base_patterns import create_wave_pattern
    # pattern = create_wave_pattern(list(matrix.leds.keys())) # Get all coords from the matrix
    # for coords, op in pattern:
    #     animation_manager.add_operation(coords[0], coords[1], op)

    print("Entering main loop (Ctrl+C to exit)...")
    try:
        while True:
            animation_manager.tick()
            time.sleep(0.01) # Main loop delay
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nShutting down...")
        matrix.shutdown()
        print("Bongo has shut down gracefully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

How This Solves Development and Testing
This clean architecture makes both development and testing scenarios straightforward:

For Developing Patterns: A developer can write a simple script that creates an LEDMatrix instance with a hard-coded configuration, completely bypassing the file loader. This allows for rapid iteration on a small part of the matrix.

# Example script: dev_pattern.py
# ... (imports) ...
dev_config = [{"row": 0, "col": 0, "controller_address": 0x40, "led_channel": 15}]
# Use a mock hardware class for development on a non-Pi machine
from src.bongo.controller.mock_pca9685 import MockPCA9685

dev_matrix = LEDMatrix(config=dev_config, default_pca9685_class=MockPCA9685)
# ... now test patterns against dev_matrix ...

For Unit Testing: The test setup in tests/conftest.py is now perfectly aligned with this structure. It should create a mock configuration dictionary and pass it to LEDMatrix, exactly as the main app does, but with a mocked hardware class. This confirms your tests are validating the same code path that production will use.
